This section provides a guide for using **xml2rfc-gui**.

Converting a Document
---------------------

The application first needs a *source document* to work with.  **xml2rfc-gui** handles a single XML document at a time for processing.  A *source document* can be loaded in one of two ways:
    1. As a command-line argument (Example ``xml2rfc-gui file.xml``)
    2. By selecting **File > Open Source** from the menu, or pressing the cooresponding keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+O or CMD+O)
    
You may then select one or more *output formats*, either by clicking the check boxes at the top of the application underneath "Outputs", or by selecting **Options > Output formats** from the menu.

Finally, press the **Convert** button to convert the document to the specified formats.  If the document was successfully converted without errors, the new documents will be available in the output directory specified in **Preferences**.  See :ref:`customization` for further information on configurable settings.

Handling Errors
---------------

It's possible during conversion that an error was encountered.  The two classes of XML errors are:
    1. XML syntax error, meaning the XML was not well-formed.
    2. DTD validation error, meaning the document violated the DTD specification.

In either case, upon reaching an error the conversion process will halt.  The **Console** window will contain verbose information about the nature of these errors, and the XML document will be shown to the user.  Any of the errors displayed in the **Console** contain clickable links, which will jump directly to the line in the XML source document that raised an error.  The line will also be highlighted.

The document may then be edited externally and reloaded, OR edited within **xml2rfc-gui** itself.

Editing XML
-----------

The application's XML view also serves as a lightweight editor.  Changes can be made to the current *source document* at any time by simply editing the text.  Note that you must save your changes before converting, either by selecting **File > Save Source** from the menu, or pressing the cooresponding keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+S or CMD+S)

.. _customization:

Customization
-------------

The application's primary behavior is customized by going to **Options > Preferences**, in which the following sections are available:

**Conversion**

    - *Output directory*: Specify the directory to create converted documents in.  Must be writable.

**Appearance**

    - *Document text*: Controls the font face and size of text in the main document view.  Also controls the showing/hiding of line numbers for XML or Text documents.
    - *Console text*: Controls the font face and size of text in the console view.

**Cache**

    - *Cache directory*: Specify the directory to cache network-accessed document references.  Must be writable
    - *Cache data*: Displays the file size of the cache and allows you to erase it.

**References**
    
    - *Locations*: A list of colon (semicolon on windows) delimited directories that the application should search in for document references.  A blank directory signifies the application to check in the directory of the source document.  Note that this list is initially populated from the environment variable $XML_LIBRARY.
    - *Network citation library*: Base URL that the application should search for document references at.

Note that all of these settings may be reverted to their original values at any time by clicking **Restore Defaults**
