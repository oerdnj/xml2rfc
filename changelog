xml2rfc (2.4.8) ietf; urgency=medium

  * From Tony Hansen <tonyh@att.com>:
    Added check of line_num+i against len(self.buf) before looking at
    self.buf[line_num+i].  Resolves issue #258.

  * Tweaked the word separator regex to handle words containing both '.' 
    and '-' internally more correctly. Fixes issue #256.

  * Now only emitting texttable word splitting warning once.

  * Changed the sort order of iref index items to not be case sensitive.  
    Fixes issue #255.

  * Generally, changed http: URLs to https:, for improved security.

xml2rfc (2.4.7) ietf; urgency=high

  This release changes the reference resolution code to try 3 different
  network hosts when trying to find bibxml reference files on the net,
  instead of trying only xml.reference.org.  It now tries, in order::

     http://xml2rfc.ietf.org/
     http://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/
     http://xml.reference.org/

  The next release is expected to change this to using https: instead of http:,
  but that change requires both that the resources be available over https,
  and that there's been explicit testing of access over https, something which
  is absent from the current test suite.

xml2rfc (2.4.6) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release addresses the known bugs in xml2rfc which has hindered the
  RFC-Editor staff from consistently using xml2rfc v2 in production (and a
  number of other bugs, too).  There still remains a number of open issues,
  and these will be addressed in upcoming releases.  Here are some details
  about the issues fixed:

  * Tweaked the forward-slash part of the word-separator regex to handle IP 
    address prefix lenght indications better.  Related to issue #252.
    Thanks to Brian Carpenter for pointing this aspect out.

  * Changed the code so as to not blow up on empty section titles.  Fixes
    issue #245.

  * Updated the textwrapping word-separator regex to handle slash-separated
    words in a similar manner as hyphenated words, to avoid line-breaks that
    place the forward slash at the start of a line.  Fixes issue #252.

  * Updated the regex for end-of-sentence exceptions to treat a single
    alphabetic character followed by period as end-of-sentence, rather than
    considering it to be the abbreviation of a given name.  This fixes issue
    #251.

  * Updated the sorting to not sort the ref keys surrounded by squere
    brackest, instead sorting only the key strings.  Fixes issue #250.  

  * Added iref handling directly under section, and for figures, both of which
    were missing previously.  Fixes issue #249.  Also modified the format in
    which iref index page lists are emitted, to combine consecutive page
    numbers into range indications, and eliminate repeat mentions of the same
    page number.  Finally, changed things to avoid compressing the double
    space between index item and page list to a single space.  This should
    bring the iref output closer to that of xml2rfc v1.

  * Removed a static copy of the initial text-list-symbols PI, instead
    consulting the master PI dictionary every time, in order to catch changes
    in the text-list-symbols setting.  Fixes issue #246

  * Made a warning conditional on not building the indexes, to avoid duplicate
    error messages.  Fixes issue #242.

  * Provided the relevant counter when creating _RfcItem objects for Figures,
    Tables, numbered References, and Crefs, to make it possible to refer to
    them by xref elements with format='counter'.  Fixes issue #241.

  * Added wrapping and indentation of long Obsoletes: and Updates: list in the
    text formats.  Fixes issue #232.

  * Tweaked the top_rfc test to require proper line wrapping for long
    Obsoletes: lines; see issue #232.

  * We're now using a blank string for source when rendering a cref element
    with no source given, rather failing to concatenate None to a string.
    Fixes issue #225.

  * Rewrote the xml expansion code to use the same serialization mechanism
    under python 2.x and 3.x, and removed external references by replacing
    the doctype declaration during lxml serialization.

  * Fixed some code that didn't work correctly under python 3.3, by making
    sure to insert unicode strings instead of byte strings into unicode
    templates.

  * Fixed a bug where text was compared with an integer when handling the
    needLines PI.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars>:

  * Fixed ticket #186 based on diffs provided by Leif Johansson <leifj@mnt.se>:
    If the first parse of the XML tree generates a syntax error, then we now 
    produce a warning of that fact.  This is in part to help me track down what 
    is happening at odd intervolts on my system where it generates an error and 
    then has entity resolution problems.

  * Fixed the case of one reference section occurring with an eref.  In this
    case we need to emit the extra header in both locations.  Fixes ticket
    #222.

  * Fixed a bug where text following a cref is missing.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  18 May 2014 16:18:22 +0200


xml2rfc (2.4.5) ietf; urgency=medium

  Another bugfix release, with a majority of the contributions from Jim Schaad.

  * If there is not an RFC number then XXXX is used for the RFC number for to
    internal:/rfc.number - matches v1 behavior.  Fixes issue #114.

  * We now do a better (but not perfect) job of mking sure that section
    headings are not orphaned.  If you have two section headings in a row then
    the first may still be orphaned.  Fixes issue #166.

  * All known page breaking issues have been fixed.  Closes issue #172.

  * Fixed a number of places where the code has to be made to work with both
    Python 2.7 unicode and string whitespace, and Python 3.3. whitespace
    strings, which are always unicode.  Fixes issue #217.

  * Don't count formatting lines (which we can now tell) when computing 
    break hints.

  * Catch any syntax errors raised while we're looking for an RFC number 
    attribute on <rfc/>, so that we'll show all syntax errors found (during the 
    next parse) instead of just one and one.

  * Added tests which generate .txt from .nroff and compares that to the 
    xml2rfc-generated .txt (with some tweaks to handle different number of 
    starting blanklines.  Also corrected the number of initial blank lines 
    output for RFCs in the raw text writer.

  * Not all files on Windows systems have a common root.  This means that one
    cannot always get a relative path between to absolute path file names.
    Catch the error that occurs in these circumstances and just use the
    absolute path name.

  * Nested "format" style lists now include the level in the auto-generated
    counter value.  Fixes issue #218.

  * EREFs are now put into the references section for text based output.
    Fixes issue #133.

  * cref elements are not dealt with when inline is either yes or no for text
    files.  They are also now populated for html files as well.  Fixes issue
    #201.

 -- Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>  17 Jan 2014 17:08:54 +0100

xml2rfc (2.4.4) ietf; urgency=medium

  Another release with major contributions from Jim Schaad.  This release
  primarily addresses page-breaking issues, but also improves the reporting
  of syntax errors (if any) in the xml input.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars.com>:

  * We now do a better (but not perfect) job of mking sure that section
    headings are not orphaned.  If you have two section headings in a row then
    the first may still be orphaned.  Fixes issue #166.

  * Improved autobreaking, in a number of different places.  Fixes issue #172.

  * In all examples in the test suite, the .txt and .nroff output now have the
    same page breaks.

  * Eliminated the line-breaking of 'Section N' in text-tables which was
    introduced in 2.4.4.  Fixes ticket #217.

  * If there is not an RFC number then XXXX is used for the RFC number for to
    internal:/rfc.number - matches v1 behavior.  Fixes issue #114.

  From Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>:

  * Instead of previously only showing one single syntax error per invocation
    of xml2rfc, we're now showing all syntax errors found throughout the xml
    file at once.

  * Added tests which generate .txt from .nroff and compares that to the 
    xml2rfc-generated .txt (with some tweaks to handle different number of 
    starting blanklines.  Also corrected the number of initial blank lines 
    output for RFCs in the raw text writer.

xml2rfc (2.4.4) ietf; urgency=medium

  This is a bugfix release, with code fixes almost entirely from Jim Schaad.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars.com>:

  * Annotations now output more than just the first text field.  It now
    expands all of the child elements as part of the output. Fixes issue #183.

  * If the authors string is zero length, then we do not emit the comma
    separating the authors and the title. Fixes issue #137.

  * Each street line is now tagged as class vcardline so it is emitted on a
    separate line. Fixes issue #153.

  * Fixed a problem with unreferenced references warnings being emitted twice
    if there were two references sections.

  * Fixed some list indentation problems.  We now default to an indent of 3
    for hanging lists which is the same thing that v1 did.  We also use a
    value based on the bullet for format lists rather than using the 3 of a
    default hang indent - this also now matches v1 behavior.

  * Use width of bullet not default to 3*level+3

  * Fixed issue #147 - a hangingText without any text in the body now emits
    the hangingText. Fixes issue #117.

  * Set of fixes that deal with xref in documents.

  * Set of fixes that deal with references.

  * We now use the anchor rather than the generated bullet as the id of the
    reference element. Fixes issue #209.

  * The html did not have the same check for symrefs when sorting references
    that the text version did.  Copy it over so they both only sort if symrefs
    is yes. Fixes issue #210 and #170.

  * Anchors on t elements in a section were referencable, but no
    those in lists.  They are now referencable. Fixes issue #149.

  * We now generate a warning when we get a target in an xref that we have not
    created an indexable reference for.  This basically gives us an internal
    error check.

  * We now generate a warning when a reference is created that is not targeted
    by an xref in the document.

  * Fixed the centering algorithm so that the nroff and txt output files are
    more consistent.

  * Left shift artwork that is greater than 69 characters wide and steal space
    from the left margin. Fixes issue #129.

  *  & 194 which deal with how figures are layout

  * Fixed issue #132 - if the artwork has an alignment - then it overrides the
    figure's version for the purpose of the artwork itself. Fixes issue #151.

  * Suppres-title kills the title decoration (i.e. Figure 1:) which matches v1
    behavior. Fixes issue #213.

  * Convert all non-ASCII characters to entities when building the HTML body.
    We now are correct when we advertise it as being a us-ascii file.

  * Mixed two fixes back to the real source tree.

  * Rewrite of the basic low level code to use unicode strings in many places
    rather than convert the unicode characters into xml entity codes and try
    to use them.  Doing so cleans up much of the line wrapping problems.

  * URLs, when tagged to be not wrapped, now use different Unicode markers on
    the slashes and hyphens so that they will preferentially break on slashes
    rather than hyphens when a URL is too long to fit into a single line of
    text.

  * Tracker issues addressed: #192, #167, #168, #193, #200, #122, #139

  * Increase the amount of text in the INSTALL document to deal with more
    information on how to install for windows. Fixes issue #184.

  * Don't emit the references section and TOC entry if there are no references
    to be emitted. Fixes issue #205.

  * Centering code did not take into account the .in X nroff command.  Always
    use .in 0 for emission of raw text. Fixes issue #203.

  * The TCL code for deciding on table column widths has been moved into the
    new code. Fixes issue #173.

  * We now look for and do expansions for header cells just like normal
    cells. Fixes issue #131.

  * We now remove all entity references when doing an xml output

  * Fixed issue #146 - The code now allows for the assumption that the file
    name given is what it really is and then tries with the .xml appended if
    it is not found. Fixes issue #154.

  * Lots of errors added to tell about bad table layouts

  * allow make to run without pyflakes. Fixes issue #199.

  From Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>:

  * Modified the code that saves page-break hints when building the
    unpaginated text so that it doesn't overwrite existing hints used for
    artwork and tables (which should not be broken across pages if at all
    possible) with hints that indicate regular text paragraphs (which may be
    broken except if that creates a widow or orphan).  Fixes issue #179 by
    making the code do for artwork and tables what needLines used to do,
    without needing the manual needLines hint.

xml2rfc (2.4.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release adds compatibility with Python 3.3; the test suite has been
  run for Python 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3 using the 'tox' tool.

  This release also includes a large number of bugfixes, from people working
  at improving xml2rfc during the IETF-88 code sprint.

  Details:

  From Tony Hansen <tony@att.com>:

  * Eliminated spurious dots before author names on page 1.  Fixes issue #189.

  * Fixed the style of nested letter-style lists.  Fixes issue #127

  * Added a handling for empty <?rfc?> PIs within references.  Fixes issue #181.

  * Removed trailing whitespace from reference title, organization.  Fixes
    issue #171.

  * Added support v1 list formats %o, %x, and %X.  Fixes issue #204.

  * Fixed a bad html selector which had a trailing '3'.  Fixes issue #197.

  From Jim Schaad <ietf@augustcellars>:

  * Removed leading zeros on dates.  Fixes issue #206.

  * Fixed a crash when a new page had just been created, and it was totally
    empty.  It is unknown if this can occur someplace other than for the last
    page, but it should have check in other locations to look for that.  In
    addition we needed a change to figure out that we had already emitted a
    header for the page we are not going to use any longer and delete it.  Fixes
    issue #187.

  * Handled the missing \& to escape a period at the beginning of a line.  If we
    do a raw emission (i.e. inside of a figure) then we need to go back over the
    lines we just put into the buffer and check to see if any of them have
    leading periods and quote them.  Fixes issue #191.

  * Removed extraneous .ce 0 and blank lines in the nroff.  Since it was using
    the paging formatter in the process of building the nroff output, it kept
    all of the blank lines at the end of each page and emitted them.  There is
    no check in the nroff page_break function which removes any empty lines at
    the end of the array prior to emitting the ".bp" directive (or not emitting
    it if it is the last thing in the file.  Fixes issue #180.

  * Now correctly picks up the day if a day is provided and uses the current day
    for a draft if the month and year are current.  We now allow for both the
    full name of the month and the abbreviated name of the month to be used,
    however there may be some interesting questions to look at if November is
    not in the current locale.  Fixes issue #195.

  * Fixed the text-list-symbols PI to work at all levels.  The list should
    inherit style from the nearest parent that has one.  Fixes issue #126.

  From Elwyn Davies <elwynd@dial.pipex.com>: 

  * Don't emit '\%' before 'Section' for xrefs in the nroff writer.  Fixes
    issue #169.

  From Henrik Levkowetz <henrik@levkowetz.com>:

  * Modified the iref index output to use consistent sorting for items
    and subitems.

  * Removed the restriction to python 2.x from setup.py

  * Ported xml2rfc to python 3.3 while maintaining compatibility with 2.6 
    and 2.7.

  * Added support for tox testing covering python versions 2.6, 2.7 and 3.3

xml2rfc (2.4.2) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release fixes all major and critical issues registered in the issue
  tracker as of 26 May 2013.  Details:

  * Applied a patch from ht@inf.ed.ac.uk to sort references (when PI
    sortrefs==yes), and added code to insert a link target if the reference
    has a 'target' attribute. Fixes issue #175.

  * Added pre-installation requirements to the INSTALL file.  Added code to
    scripts/xml2rfc in order to avoid problems if that file is renamed to
    scripts/xml2rfc.py.  This fixes issue #152.

  * Added a setup requirement for python <3.0, as things don't currently
    work if trying to run setup.py or xml2rfc with python 3.X.

  * Added special cases to avoid adding double spaces after many common
    abbreviations.  Refined the sentence-end double-space fixup further, to
    look at whether what follows looks like the start of a new sentence.
    This fixes issue #115.  

  * Moved the get_initials() function to the BaseRfcWriter, as it now needs
    to look at a PI.  Added code to return one initial only, or multiple,
    depending on the PI 'multiple-initials' setting.  Fixes issue #138 (for
    now).  It is possible that this resolution is too simpleminded, and a
    cleaner way is needed to differentiate the handling of initials in the
    current document versus initials in references.

  * Added new undocumented PI multiple-initials to control whether multiple
    initials will be shown for an author, or not.  The default is 'no',
    matching the xml2rfc v1.x behaviour.

  * Fixed the code which determines when an author affiliation doesn't need
    to be listed again in the front page author list, and removes the
    redundant affiliation (the old code would remove the *first* matching
    organization, rather than the immediately preceeding organization name).
    Also fixed a buggy test of when an organization element is present.
    Fixes issue #135.

  * Made appearance of 'Authors Address' (etc.) in ToC dependent on PI
    'rfcedstyle' == 'yes'.  Fixes issue #125.

  * Updated write_text() to handle long bullets that need to be wrapped
    across lines better.  Fixes issue #124.

  * Fixed two other cases of missing blank lines when PI 'compact' is 'no'.
    Fixes issue #82 (some more).

  * Disabled the iprnotified IP.  See issue #123; closes #123.

  * When protecting http: URLs from line-breaking in nroff output, place the
    \% outside enclosing parentheses, if any.  Fixes issue #120.

  * Added a warning for incomplete and out-of-date <date/> elements.  Fixed
    an issue with changeset [792].

  * Issue a warning when the source file isn't for an RFC, but doesn't have
    a docName attribute in the <rfc/> element.

  * Fixed the use of separating lines in table drawing, to match v1 for text
    and nroff output.  (There is no specification for the meaining of the
    different styles though...).  Fixes issue #113.  Note that additional
    style definitions are needed to get the correct results for the html
    output.

  * Refactored and re-wrote the paginated text writer and the nroff writer
    in order to generate a ToC in nroff by re-using the fairly complex
    post-rendering code which inserts the ToC (and iref entries) in the
    paginated text writer.  As a side effect, the page-breaking calculations
    for the nroff writer becomes the same as for the paginated writer.
    Re-factored the line and page-break emitting code to be cleaner and more
    readable.  Changed the code to not start inserting a ToC too close to
    the end of a page (currently hardcoded to require at least 10 lines),
    otherwise skip to a new page.  Fixes issue #109.

  * Changed the author list in first-page header to show a blank line if no
    organization has been given.  Fixes issue #108.

  * Changed the wrapping of nroff output to match text output closely, in
    order to minimize insertion of .bp in the middle of a line.  Fixes issue
    #150 (mostly -- line breaks on hyphens may still cause .bp to be emitted
    in the middle of a line in very rare cases).

  * Changed nroff output for long titles (which will wrap) so that the
    wrapped title text will be indented appropriately.  Fixes issue #128.

  * Changed the handling of special characters (nbsp, nbhy) so as to emit
    the proper non-breaking escapes for nroff.  Fixes issue #121.

  * Changed start-of-line nroff escape handling, see issue #118.

  * Changed the generation of xref text to use the same numeric indexes as
    in the references section when symrefs='no'.  Don't start numbering over
    again when starting a new references section (i.e., when moving from
    normative to informative).  Don't re-sort numeric references
    alphabetically; they are already sorted numerically.  Fixes issue #107.

  * Changed os.linesep to '<NL>' when writing lines to text files.  The
    library takes care of doing the right thing on different platforms;
    writing os.linesep on the other hand will result in the file containing
    '<CR><CR><NL>', which is wrong.  Fixes issue #141.

  * Changed handling of include PIs to replace the PI instead of just
    appending the included tree.  Updated a test file to match updated test
    case.  Fixes issue #136.

xml2rfc (2.4.1) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a problem with very long hangindent bullet text followed by
    <vspace/>, which could make xml2rfc abort with a traceback for
    certain inputs.

  * Fixed a mismatched argument count for string formatting which could
    make xml2rfc abort with a traceback for certain inputs.

xml2rfc (2.4.0) ietf; urgency=medium

  With this release, all issues against the 2.x series of xml2rfc has been
  resolved.  Without doubt there will be new issues in the issue tracker,
  but the current clean slate is nice to have.

  For full details on all tickets, there's always the issue tracker:
  https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/report/

  An extract from the commit log is available below:

  * In some cases, the error messages when validating an xml document are 
    correct, but too obscure.  If a required element is absent, the error 
    message could say for instance 'Element references content does not follow 
    the DTD, expecting (reference)+, got ', which is correct -- the DTD 
    validator  got nothing, when it required something, so it says 'got ', with 
    nothing after 'got'.  But for a regular user, we now add on 'nothing.' to 
    make things clearer.  Fixes issue #102.

  * It seems there could be a bug in separate invocation of 
    lxml.etree.DTD.validate(tree) after parsing, compared to doing parsing with 
    dtd_validation=True.  The former fails in a case when it shouldn't, while 
    the latter succeeds in validating a valid document.  Declaring validation 
    as successful if the dtd.error_log is empty, even if validation returned 
    False.  This resolves issue #103.

  * Factored out the code which gets an author's initials from the xml 
    author element, and made the get_initials() utility function return 
    initials fixed up with trailing spaces, if missing.  The current code does 
    not mangle initials by removing any initials but the first one.  Fixes 
    issue #63, closes issue #10.


  * Added code to avoid breaking URLs in boilerplate across lines.  Fixes 
    issue #78.
  * Added PI defaults for 'figurecount' and 'tablecount' (not listed in the 
    xml2rfc readme...)  Also removed coupling between explicitly set 
    rfcedstyle, compact, and subcompact settings, to follow v1 practice.

  * Refactored the PI defaults to appear all in the same place, rather than 
    spread out throughout the code.


  * Updated draw_table to insert blank rows when PI compact is 'no'. Fixes 
    issue #82.

  * Added tests and special handling for the case when a hanging type list 
    has less space left on the first line, after the bullet, than what's needed 
    for the first following word.  In that case, start the list text on the 
    following line.  Fixes issue #85.

  * Modified the page-breaking code to better keep section titles together 
    with the section text, and keep figure preamble, figure, postamble and 
    caption together.  Updated tests.  Fixes issue #100.

  * Added handling of tocdepth to the html writer.  Fixes issue #101.

  * Modified how the --base switch to the xml2rfc script works, to make it 
    easier to generate multiple output formats and place them all in the same 
    target directory.  Also changed the default extensions for two output 
    formats (.raw.txt and .exp.xml).

  * Tweaked the html template to not permit crazy wide pages.

  * Rewrote parts of the parsing in order to get hold of the number 
    attribute of the <rfc/> tag before the full parsing is done, in order to be 
    able to later resolve the &rfc.number; entity (which, based on how 
    convoluted it is to get that right, I'd like to deprecate.)  Fixes issue 
    #86.

  * Numerous small fixes to indentation and wrapping of references.  Avoid 
    wrapping URLs in references if possible.  Avoid wrapping 'Section 3.14.' if 
    possible.  Indent more like xml2rfc v1.

  * Added reduction of doublespaces in regular text, except when they might 
    be at the end of a sentence.  Xml2rfc v1 would do this, v2 didn't till now.

  * Generalized the _format_counter() method to consistently handle list 
    counter field-widths internally, and made it adjust the field-width to the 
    max counter width based on the list length and counter type.  Fixes an v1 
    to -v2 incompatibility for numbered lists with 10 items or more, and other 
    similar cases.

  * Added generic base conversion code, and used that to generate list 
    letters which will work for lists with more than 26 items.

  * Reworked code to render roman numerals in lists, to place whitespace 
    correctly in justification field.  Fixes issue #94.

  * Added consensus vs. no-consensus options for IAB RFCs' Status of This 
    Memo section.  Fixes issue #88.

  * Made <t/> elements with an anchor attribute generate html with an <a 
    name='...'/> elemnt, for linking.  Closes issue #67.

  * Applied boilerplate URL-splitting prevention only in the raw writer 
    where later do paragraph line-wrapping, instead of generically.  Fixes 
    issue #62.

  * Now permitting all versions of lxml >= 2.2.8, but notice that there may 
    be missing build dependencies for lxml 3.x which may cause installation of 
    lxml to fail.  (That's an lxml issue, rather than an xml2rfc issue, 
    though...)  This fixes issue #99.

xml2rfc (2.3.11.3) ietf; urgency=medium

  * Tweaked the install_required setting in setup.py to not pull down lxml 3.x
    (as it's not been tested with xml2rfc) and bumped the version.

xml2rfc (2.3.11) ietf; urgency=medium

  This release fixes all outstanding major bugs, details below.
  The issue tracker is at https://tools.ietf.org/tools/xml2rfc/trac/.

  * Updated the nroff writer to do backslash escaping on source text, to 
    avoid escaping nroff control characters.  Fixes issue #77.

  * Added a modified xref writer to the nroff output writer, in order to 
    handle xref targets which should not be broken across lines.  This, 
    together with changeset [688], fixes issue #80.

  * Added text to the section test case to trigger the second part of issue 
    #79.  It turns out that the changes in [688] fixed this, too; this closes 
    issue #79.

  * Tweaked the nroff generation to not break on hyphens, in order to avoid 
    hyphenated words ending up with embedded spaces: 'pre-processing' becoming 
    'pre- processing' if 'pre-' occurred at the end of an nroff text line.  
    Also tweaked the line-width used in line-breaking to have matching 
    line-breaks between .txt and .nroff output (with exception for lines ending 
    in hyphens).

  * Tweaked roman number list counter to output roman numbers in a field 5 
    spaces wide, instead of having varied widths.  This is different from 
    version 1, so may have to be reverted, depending on how people react.

  * Added a warning for too long lines in figures and tables.  No 
    outdenting for now; I'd like to consult some about that. Fixes issue #76.

  * Updated tests showing that all list format specifiers mentioned in 
    issue #70 now works.  Closes isssue #70.

  * Changed spanx emphasis back to _this_ instead of -this-, matching the v1 
    behaviour.  Addresses issue #70.

  * Make <vspace/> in a hangindent list reset the indentation to the 
    hang-indent, even if the bullet text is longer than the hang-indent.  
    Addresses issue #70.

  * Refined the page-breaking to not insert an extra page break for artwork
    that won't fit on a page anyway.

  * Refined the page-breaking to avoid breaking artwork and tables across 
    pages, if possible.

  * Fixed a problem with centering of titles and labels.  Fixes issue #73.

  * Changed the leading and trailing whitespace lines of a page to better 
    match legacy output.  Fixed the autobreaking algorithm to correctly avoid 
    orphans and widows; fixes issue #72.  Removed an extra blank line at the 
    top of the page following an early page break to avoid orphan or widow.

  * Tweaked the generation of ToC dot-lines and page numbers to better 
    match legacy xml2rfc.  Fixed a bug in the generation of xref text where 
    trailing whitespace could cause double spaces.  Tweaked the output format 
    to produce the correct number of leading blank lines on the first page of a 
    document.

  * Modified the handling of figure titles, so that given titles will be 
    written also without anchor or figure counting.  Fixes issue #75.

  * Tweaked the html writer to have a buffer interface that provides a 
    self.buf similar to the other writers, for test purposes.

  * Reworked the WriterElementTest suite to test all the output formats, 
    not only paginated text.

  * Added a note about /usr/local/bin permissions.  This closes issue #65.

  * Added files describing possible install methods (INSTALL), and possible 
    build commands (Makefile).

  * The syntax that was used to specify the version of the lxml dependency 
    ('>=') is not supported in python distutil setup.py files, and caused setup 
    to try to find an lxml version greater than =2.2.8, which couldn't succeed. 
    Fixed to say '>2.2.7' instead.  This was probably the cause of always 
    reinstalling lxml even when it was present.

  * Updated README.rst to cover the new --date option, and tweaked it a bit.

  * Added some files to provide an enhanced source distribution package.

  * Updated setup.py with maintainer and licence information.

xml2rfc (2.3.10) ietf; urgency=low

  * Changed the output text for Internet-Draft references to omit the 
    series name, but add (work in progress).  Updated the test case to match 
    draft revision number.

  * Updated all the rfc editor boilerplate in valid test facits to match the 
    correct outcome (which is also what the code actually produces).

  * Changed the diff test error message so that the valid text is output as 
    the original, not as the changed text of a diff.

  * Corrected test cases to match correct expiry using 185 days instead of 
    183 days from document date.

  * Added missing attributes to the XmlRfcError Exception subclass, 
    necessary in order to make it resemble lxml's error class and provide 
    consistent error messages to the user whether they come from lxml or our 
    own code.

  * Added a licence file, indicating the licencing used by the IETF for the 
    xml2rfc code.

  * Fixed up the xml2rfc cli script to provide better help texts by telling 
    the option parser the appropriate option variable names.

  * Fixed up the help text formatting by explicitly providing an appropriate
    help text formatter to the option parser.  

  * Added an option (--date=DATE)to provide the document date on the command
    line.

  * Added an option (--no-dtd) to disable the DTD validation step.  

  * Added code to catch additional exceptions and provide appropriate user
    information, instead of an exception traceback.
