Disclaimer: This package is not in Debian's main archive because it
 contains sections of redistributable (but not modifiable) documents
 licensed by the IETF Trust.  Discussions are underway to try to get
 rights to modify the sections to bring the package back into main.
 Note that the output produced by xml2rfc may also include more
 restrictive copyright statements, to conform with ISOC and IETF
 requirements.  This should not affect the DFSG-freeness of the
 xml2rfc package itself.
