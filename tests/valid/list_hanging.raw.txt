   Lists with 'hanging labels': the list item is indented the amount of
   the hangIndent:

   Item A: Here is an example of a setence that follows the "hangText"
           in a list item in a hanging list.

   Item B with a much longer label:  Here is an example if the text
           following the "hangText" is long and wraps, the indent (set
           to 8 in the XML) is used.

   Item C: 
           Here's an example where a vspace element has been inserted so
           the text starts on a new line (instead of next to the
           "hangText".

           And something which should look like a new paragraph for the
           same hangindent item.

   Item D with a very longer label followed by <vspace/>:  
           Here is an example if the text following the "hangText" is
           long and wraps, the indent (set to 8 in the XML) is used.

   RFC 4662, A Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Notification
   Extension for Resource Lists (S):  RFC 4662 [RFC4662] defines an
      extension to RFC 6665 that allows a client to subscribe to a list
      of resources using a single subscription.  The server, called a
      Resource List Server (RLS) will "expand" the subscription and
      subscribe to each individual member of the list.  Its primary
      usage with presence is to allow subscriptions to "buddy lists".
      Without RFC 4662, a UA would need to subscribe to each presentity
      individually.  With RFC 4662, they can have a single subscription
      to all buddies.  A user can manage the entries in their buddy list
      using the provisioning mechanisms in [sec-prov], below.
