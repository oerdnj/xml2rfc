1.  Introduction

   This document presents a technique for using Pandoc syntax as a
   source format for documents in the Internet-Drafts (I-Ds) and Request
   for Comments (RFC) series.

   This version is adapted to work with "xml2rfc" version 2.x.

   Pandoc is an "almost plain text" format and therefor particularly
   well suited for editing RFC-like documents.

      Note: this document is typeset in Pandoc and does not render
      completely correct when reading it on github.

2.  Pandoc to RFC

      Pandoc2rfc -- designed to do the right thing, until it doesn't.

   When writing [RFC4641] we directly wrote the XML.  Needless to say it
   was tedious even thought the XML of xml2rfc [1] is very "light".  The
   latest version of xml2rfc version 2 can be found here [2].

   During the last few years people have been developing markup
   languages that are very easy to remember and type.  These languages
   have become known as "almost plain text"-markup languages.  One of
   the first was the Markdown [3] syntax.  One that was developed later
   and incorporates Markdown and a number of extensions is Pandoc [4].
   The power of Pandoc also comes from the fact that it can be
   translated to numerous output formats, including, but not limited to:
   HTML, (plain) Markdown and "docbook" XML.

   So using Pandoc for writing RFCs seems like a sane choice.  As
   "xml2rfc" uses XML, the easiest way would be to create "docbook" XML
   and transform that using XSLT.  Pandoc2rfc does just that.  The
   conversions are, in some way amusing, as we start off with (almost)
   plain text, use elaborate XML and end up with plain text again.

Internet-Draft            Pandoc2rfc Version 2              January 2013


   +-------------------+   pandoc   +---------+
   | ALMOST PLAIN TEXT |   ------>  | DOCBOOK |
   +-------------------+            +---------+
                 |                       |
   non-existent  |                       | xsltproc
     faster way  |                       |
                 v                       v
         +------------+    xml2rfc  +---------+
         | PLAIN TEXT |  <--------  | XML2RFC |
         +------------+             +---------+

                 Figure 1: Attempt to justify Pandoc2rfc.

   The XML generated (the output after the "xsltproc" step in Figure 1)
   is suitable for inclusion in either the "middle" or "back" section of
   an RFC.  The simplest way is to create a template XML file and
   include the appropriate XML:

   <?xml version='1.0' ?>
   <!DOCTYPE rfc SYSTEM 'rfc2629.dtd' [
   <!ENTITY pandocMiddle PUBLIC '' 'middle.xml'>
   <!ENTITY pandocBack   PUBLIC '' 'back.xml'>
   ]>

   <rfc ipr='trust200902' docName='draft-gieben-pandoc-rfcs-02'>
    <front>
       <title>Writing I-Ds and RFCs using Pandoc v2</title>
   </front>

   <middle>
       &pandocMiddle;
   </middle>

   <back>
       &pandocBack;
   </back>

   </rfc>

                     Figure 2: A minimal template.xml.

   See the Makefile for an example of this.  In this case you need to
   edit 3 documents:

   1.  middle.pdc - contains the main body of text;

   2.  back.pdc - holds appendices and references;

   3.  template.xml (probably a fairly static file).

   The draft ("draft.txt") you are reading now, is automatically created
   when you call "make".  The homepage of Pandoc2rfc is this github
   repository [5].

2.1.  Dependencies

   It needs "xsltproc" and "pandoc" to be installed.  See the Pandoc
   user manual for the details [6] on how to type in Pandoc style.  And
   ofcourse "xml2rfc" version two.

   When using Pandoc2rfc consider adding the following sentence to an
   Acknowledgements section:

    This document was produced using the Pandoc2rfc tool.

3.  Starting a new project

   When starting a new project with "pandoc2rfc" you'll need to copy the
   following files:

   o  "Makefile"

   o  "transform.xslt"

   o  And the above mentioned files:

      *  "middle.pdc"

      *  "back.pdc"

      *  "template.xml"

   After that you can start editing.

4.  Supported Features

   o  Sections with an anchor and title attributes (Section 7.2);

   o  Lists

      *  style=symbols (Section 7.3.1);

      *  style=numbers (Section 7.3.2);

      *  style=empty (Section 7.3.3);

      *  style=format %i, use roman lowercase numerals, (Section 7.3.4);

      *  style=format (%d), use roman uppercase numerals
         (Section 7.3.4);

      *  style=letters (lower- and uppercase, Section 7.3.5);

      *  style=hanging (Section 7.3.6);

   o  Figure/artwork with a title (Section 7.4);

   o  Block quote this is converted to "<list style="empty">" paragraph
      (Section 7.5);

   o  References

      *  external (eref) (Section 7.6.1);

      *  internal (xref) (Section 7.6.2), you can refer to:

         +  section (handled by Pandoc, see Section 7.6));

         +  figures (handled by XSLT, see Section 7.4.1);

         +  tables (handled by XSLT, see Section 7.8.1).

   o  Citations, by using internal references;

   o  Spanx style=verb, style=emph and style=strong (Section 7.7);

   o  Tables with an anchor and title (Section 7.8);

   o  Indexes, by using footnotes (Section 7.9).

5.  Unsupported Features

   o  Lists inside a table ("xml2rfc" doesn't handle this);

   o  Pandoc markup in the caption for figures/artwork.  Pandoc markup
      for table captions _is_ supported;

   o  crefs: for comments (no input syntax available), use HTML
      comments: "<!-- ... -->";

6.  Acknowledgements

   The following people have helped to make Pandoc2rfc what it is today:
   Benno Overeinder, Erlend Hamnaberg, Matthijs Mekking, Trygve
   Laugstoel.

   This document was prepared using Pandoc2rfc.

7.  Pandoc Constructs

   So, what syntax do you need to use to get the correct output?  Well,
   it is _just_ Pandoc.  The best introduction to the Pandoc style is
   given in this README from Pandoc itself [7].

   For convenience we list the most important ones in the following
   sections.

7.1.  Paragraph

   Paragraphs are separated with an empty line.

7.2.  Section

   Just use the normal sectioning commands available in Pandoc, for
   instance:

   # Section1 One
   Bla

   Converts to: "<section title="Section1 One" anchor="section1-one">"
   If you have another section that is also named "Section1 One", that
   anchor will be called "section1-one-1", but _only_ when the sections
   are in the _same_ source file!

   Referencing the section is done with "see [](#section1-one)", as in
   see Section 7.2.

7.3.  List Styles

   A good number of styles are supported.

7.3.1.  Symbol

   A symbol list.

   * Item one;
   * Item two.

Internet-Draft            Pandoc2rfc Version 2              January 2013


   Converts to "<list style="symbol">":

   o  Item one;

   o  Item two.

7.3.2.  Number

   A numbered list.

   1. Item one;
   1. Item two.

   Converts to "<list style="numbers">":

   1.  Item one;

   2.  Item two.

7.3.3.  Empty

   Using the default list markers from Pandoc:

   A list using the default list markers.

   #. Item one;
   #. Item two.

   Converts to "<list style="empty">":

      Item one;

      Item two.

7.3.4.  Roman

   Use the supported Pandoc syntax:

   ii. Item one;
   ii. Item two.

   Converts to "<list style="format %i.">":

   i.    Item one;

   ii.   Item two.

   If you use uppercase Roman numerals, they convert to a different
   style:

   II. Item one;
   II. Item two.

   Yields "<list style="format (%d) ">":

   (1)  Item one;

   (2)  Item two.

7.3.5.  Letter

   A numbered list.

   a.  Item one;
   b.  Item two.

   Converts to "<list style="letters">":

   a.  Item one;

   b.  Item two.

   Uppercasing the letters works too (note two spaces after the letter.

   A.  Item one;
   B.  Item two.

   Becomes:

   A.  Item one;

   B.  Item two.

7.3.6.  Hanging

   This is more like a description list, so we need to use:

Internet-Draft            Pandoc2rfc Version 2              January 2013


   First item that needs clarification:

   :   Explanation one
   More stuff, because item is difficult to explain.
   * item1
   * item2

   Second item that needs clarification:

   :   Explanation two

   Converts to: "<list style="hanging">" and "<t hangText="First item
   that...">"

   If you want a newline after the hangTexts, search for the string
   "OPTION" in "transform.xsl" and uncomment it.

7.4.  Figure/Artwork

   Indent the paragraph with 4 spaces.

   Like this

   Converts to: "<figure><artwork> ..." Note that "xml2rfc" supports a
   caption with "<artwork>".  Pandoc does not support this, but
   Pandoc2rfc does.  If you add a "@Figure: some text" as the last line,
   the artwork gets a "title" attribute with the text after "@Figure:".
   It will also be possible to reference the artwork.  If a caption is
   supplied the artwork will be centered.  If a caption is needed but
   the figure should not be centered use "@figure:\".

7.4.1.  References

   The reference anchor attribute will be: "fig:" + "first 10
   (normalized) characters from the caption".  Where normalized means:

   o  Take the first 10 characters of the caption (i.e. this is the text
      _after_ the string "@Figure:");

   o  Spaces and single quotes (') are translated to a minus "-";

   o  Uppercase letters translated to lowercase.

   So the first artwork with a caption will get "fig:a-minimal-" as a
   reference.  See for instance Figure 2.

Internet-Draft            Pandoc2rfc Version 2              January 2013


   This anchoring is completely handled from within the "xslt".  Note
   that duplicate anchors are an XML validation error which will make
   "xml2rfc" fail.

7.5.  Block Quote

   Any paragraph like:

   > quoted text

   Converts to: "<t><list style="empty"> ..." paragraph, making it
   indented.

7.6.  References

7.6.1.  External

   Any reference like:

   [Click here](URI)

   Converts to: "<ulink target="URI">Click here ..."

7.6.2.  Internal

   Any reference like:

   [Click here](#localid)

   Converts to: "<link target="localid">Click here ..."

   For referring to RFCs (for which you manually need add the reference
   source in the template, with an external XML entity), you can just
   use:

   [](#RFC2119)

   And it does the right thing.  Referencing sections is done with:

   See [](#pandoc-constructs)

   The word 'Section' is inserted automatically: ... see Section 7 ...
   For referencing figures/artworks see Section 7.4.  For referencing
   tables see Section 7.8.

Internet-Draft            Pandoc2rfc Version 2              January 2013


7.7.  Spanx Styles

   The verb style can be selected with back-tics: "`text`" Converts to:
   "<spanx style="verb"> ..."

   And the emphasis style with asterisks: "*text*" or underscores:
   "_text_" Converts to: "<spanx style="emph"> ..."

   And the emphasis style with double asterisks: "**text**" Converts to:
   "<spanx style="strong"> ..."

7.8.  Tables

   A table can be entered as:

     Right     Left     Center     Default
     -------   ------ ----------   -------
          12     12        12        12
         123     123       123       123
           1     1         1         1

     Table: A caption describing the table.

      Figure 3: A caption describing the figure describing the table.

   Is translated to "<texttable>" element in "xml2rfc".  You can choose
   multiple styles as input, but they all are converted to the same
   style (plain "<texttable>") table in "xml2rfc".  The column alignment
   is copied over to the generated XML.

7.8.1.  References

   The caption is _always_ translated to a "title" attribute.  If a
   table has a caption, it will _also_ get a reference.  The reference
   anchor attribute will be: "tab:" + "first 10 (normalized) characters
   from the caption".  Where normalized means:

   o  Take the first 10 characters of the caption (i.e. this is the text
      _after_ the string "Table:");

   o  Spaces and single quotes (') are translated to a minus "-";

   o  Uppercase letters translated to lowercase.

   So the first table with a caption will get "tab:a-caption-" for
   reference use.  See for instance

   This anchoring is completely handled from within the "xslt".  Note
   that duplicate anchors are an XML validation error which will make
   "xml2rfc" fail.

7.9.  Indexes

   The footnote syntax of Pandoc is slightly abused to support an index.
   Footnotes are entered in two steps, you have a marker in the text,
   and later you give actual footnote text.  Like this:

   [^1]

   [^1]: footnote text

   We re-use this syntax for the "<iref>" tag.  The above text
   translates to:

   <iref item="footnote text"/>

   Sub items are also supported.  Use an exclamation mark ("!") to
   separate them:

   [^1]: item!sub item

8.  Usage guidelines

8.1.  Working with multiple files

   As an author you will probably break up a draft in multiple files,
   each dealing with a subject or section.  When doing so sections with
   the same title will clash with each other.  Pandoc can deal with this
   situation, but only if the different sections are in the _same_ file
   or processed in the same Pandoc run.  Concatenating the different
   section files before processing them is a solution to this problem.
   You can, for instance, amend the "Makefile" and add something like
   this:

   allsections.pdc: section.pdc.1 section.pdc.2 section.pdc.3
           cat $@ > allsections.pdc

   And then process "allsection.pdc" in the normal way.

8.2.  Setting the title

   If you use double quotes in the documents title in the "docName"
   attribute, like:

   <rfc ipr="trust200902" docName="draft-gieben-writing-rfcs-pandoc-02">

Internet-Draft            Pandoc2rfc Version 2              January 2013


   The Makefile will pick this up automatically and make a symbolic
   link:

   draft-gieben-writing-rfcs-pandoc-00.txt -> draft.txt

   This makes uploading the file to the i-d tracker a bit easier.

8.3.  Uploading the XML/txt

   The "draft.xml" target will generate an XML file with all XML
   included, so you can upload just one file to the I-D tracker.

8.4.  VIM syntax highlighting

   If you are a VIM user you might be interested in a syntax
   highlighting file (see [VIM]) that slightly lightens up your reading
   experience while viewing a draft.txt from VIM.

   This table has no caption, and therefor no reference.  But you can
   refer to some of the other tables, with for instance:

   See [](#tab:here-s-the)

   Which will become "See Table 2".

   We should also be able to refer to the table numbers directly, to say
   things like 'Look at Tables 1, 2 and 3.'
